<h3><u>Present Perfect Continuous</u></h3>
<pre>
<ol><h4>
We use the Present Perfect Continuous
for an activity that has recently stopped
or just stopped.
There is a connection with now</h4>

<li>You are out of breath.Have you been running.
<li>Paul is very tired.He has been working very hard.
<li>Why are your clothes so dirty ?
What have you been doing ?
<li>I've been talking to carol 
about the problem and he thinks that.
<li>It has been raining for two hours.
It is raining now.
It began raining two hours ago and
it is still raining.
<li>How long has it been raining ?
It has been raing for two hours.

<h4>We often use the Present Perfect Continuous in this way
,especially with how long,for...and since...
The activity is still
happening(in this example) 
or has just stopped.

</h4>
<li>How long have you been learning English ?
(you are still learning English)
<li>Tom is still watching television.
He has been watching television all day.
<li>Where have you been ?

<li>George hasn't been feeling well recently.

<h4>
We can use the Present Perfect Continuous for actions
repeated over a period of time.

<li>Ann's clothes are covered in paint.

<h4>
We are interested in the activity.
It does not matter whether something 
has been finished or not.
In this example,the activity
(painting the ceiling has not been finished)

The ceiling was white.Now it is blue.
She has painted the ceiling.Here,the important
thing is that something has been finished.

'Has Painted' is a completed action.
We are interested in the result of the activity.
(the Painted ceiling),not in the activity itself.

how much,how many,how many times(completed actions)
</h4>

<li>They have played tennis three times this week.

<h4>
There are some verbs (for example,know,like,believe)
that are normally not used in the continuous

just stopped)

<h4>The continuous is more usual with 
how long and for
</h4>

for a long time.

<h4>

or simple
with live and work.
But we use simple with 'always'.

London for a long time.
