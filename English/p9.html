<h3><u>The Present Perfect</u></h3>
<pre>
<ol>
<h5>It is used when we wish to express
the idea that some activity that 
took place in the past,
or a situation that originated in the past,
is connected in some way with the present.

It may be the recent past that is refered to,
a more distant past,or an indeterminate past.

The nearness or remoteness of the time
is not material,for the perfect tense merely
states the position 
at the present moment.

The Continuative Use

This states sth that has been continuous 
from the past
up to the present moment
</h4>
We have known each other for the past ten years.
(the situation still exists:we still know each other)

(we still live in this house)

(I still do not drink alcoholic liquor.)


<h5>The Inclusive Use

This represents a completed activity
or occurrence falling within a period
extending from some point of time 
in the past up to the present.
</h4>

 
There have been two major wars during the present
century.
My father has seen the Niagara Falls.
He has been a teacher,a sales representative,a book seller,
and now he is a journalist.

<h5>
This use of the perfect is often employed 
when we are speaking
or writng about the career of a person
who is still living.
</h4>

He has held the following offices.
<h5>
It also occurs with before,when before means
'some time in the past,
reckoning back from the present moment'.
</h4>

<h5>The resultative Use


This represents an activity completed
in the past-either 
recent or more remote, as:

a) Giving rise to a certain result in the present</h4>

<h5>
In (a) the emphasis is usually 
on the resultant position,
In (b) on the inference from the result.

The Perfect of Experience

or what has been the case
within the speaker's or the writer's experience
