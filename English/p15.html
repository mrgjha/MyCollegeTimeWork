<h3><u>The Simple Present,The present Continuous and The Simple Past</u></h3>
<pre>
<ol>

<li>At this moment you are reading this sentence.
<li>I am writing.(now)
<li>The teacher is talking.(now)
<li>The students are listnening(now)
<li>It is raining (now)


Verb groups that have this form(be +verb+ -ing) 
are also used to show repeated actions 
that occur over a special period of time 
as different from those that are 
more generally regular or habitual.

<li>I am studying French this year.
<li>He is going to college by bus now-a-days.
<li>He is typing his own letters these days.

<li>He (usually) goes to college by train,
but he is going to the college by bus this week.
<li>Usually his typist types his letter,
but he is going to the college by bus this week.
<li>I generally get up at six evrymorning,
but I am getting up at five during this month.

The present continuous,like the simple present can 
show a habitual activity;
but when the present continuous forms is
used to show habitual activity 
it carries an overtone of some emotion.


<li>My car is always breaking down(shows irritation)
<li>My car always breaks down(just a statement)

<li>Vinod is often coming late to 
class these days.(shows emotion,irritation,
surprise,etc)
<li>Vinod always comes late to class.(just a statement)


For a more permanent activity or state,
the simple present is used;
for a less permamnent action,
even if it is not going on at a particular time,
the present continuous is used.

<li>He smokes too much.(more permanent)
<li>He is smoking too much these days.(Less permamnent)


Notice a similar distinction 
in the case of non-action verbs

Formal

<li>I hope to go away next week.
<li>I hope to see you soon.
Informal

<li>I am hoping to spend my holidays in Kashmir.
<li>I am hoping to see you soon.


The present continuous is 
used if the speaker feels that 
the perceptions and 
mental processes are in formation.


The present continuous is 
also used to show an action
in progress coincidental 
with some other action:

<li>On my way to work I 
generally meet children who are
going to school.

<li>We are all together.
I am writing;he is singing;
she is dancing and you are doing nothing.
