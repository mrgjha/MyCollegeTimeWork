About a month ago I was feeling really fed up
with my job:

Nothing was going right and I hated going to work.
My boss was always getting at me--
ordering me around and telling me 
I hadn't done things properly:


I just couldn't put up with it any longer.
I'd even gone off the work itself.

I used to like it,but I wasn't getting 
any enjoyment out of it any more.

Then one day the boss came in and accused me 
of turning late for work all the time.


I couldn't believe it.I had only been 
late once that month and he was always 
drifting in halfway through the morning.

I asked him where He had got hold of
this information and he said that 
one of the secretaries had told him.

I said that it just wasn't true and that 
she must be picking on me because 
she did not like me.

Anybody I got really annoyed and
in the end just stormed out slamming the door 
behind  me I handed in my resignation and left that day.

Well fortunately things have picked up 
since then I took up evening classes in 
Photography after leaving my job and met
a solicitor there.She came up with the idea
that I should go and work in her office,so I did

It's much more interesting than the last job so
as it happened,things worked out well in the end.
