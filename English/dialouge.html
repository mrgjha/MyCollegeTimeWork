5.6 PRONUNCIATION

Intonation

We shall now introduce you to intonation patterns in English.

Tone Groups

A longer sentence is usually divided into what may be called breath groups. or sense groups. We also call them tone groups.

Example:

When I went to see him/he was still in bed.
(The tone group division is shown by the oblique bar/)


1	By the time we got home, it was already dark.
2   	I'll send him an answer, as soon as I can.
3   	If you need anything elsc, just ask me.
4   	By refusing to answer you'll only make matters worse.
5.  	Going through your papers, I was surprised to find that you'd studied journalism.

The Nucleus

The last important word in each group has what is called the nucleus. 
On the stressed syllable of this word there is a movement of the pitch of the speaker's 
voice from high low or low to high.

Tones

The change in pitch from high to low is known as the falling tone, 
and the change in pitch from low to high is known as the rising tone.

The Falling Tone

We shall show the falling tone with a stanting mark pointing downward placed before the nucleus.

The falling tone is generally used in
a)	statements; for example
      	1	I `haven't the time
      	2	I'm `going home.
3	There's `no re'ply

b)	questions beginning with a question-word such as what. how, when etc; for example.
      	1	`What's the `time?
      	2	`Where's he `gone?
     		3	`When will they `come?
      	4	`Why are they `late?
      	5	`How many have you `got?
      	6	`How much d'you `need?

c)	commands: for example.
      	1	(lose the) door
2	`Bring it back at `once.

d)	exclamations: for example
      	1  	What an `excellent i'dea!
2	How extra`ordinary!

e)    question tags, when agreement is expected: for example,
        	1  	It's rather `hot today. /`isn't it?
        	2  	This is a difficult `question, /`isn't it?

Exercise 15

Now look at the following words and sentences, which have a falling tone on the nucleus, and listen to them on the cassette. Then say each word and sentence with a falling tone. Make sure that the pitch of your voice moves from a higher level to a lower level on the nucleus.

1       to`morrow
        They're `coming to`morrow.
2       `light
        `Switch on the `light.
3       `time
        `Don't waste my `time
4       `papers
        `Where are the `papers?
5       lunsh
        `When d'you ex'pect to `finish it?
6       `coffee
        Let's go and have some `coffee.

Exercise 16



1.  A: `Why don't you `buy a `car?
    B: I `haven't got the `money.
2.  A: `Have some `coffee.
    B: I'd `rather have some `juice.
3.  A: `Open that `door.
    B: But it's `jammed.
    A: Well, `get the `carpenter to open it.
    	 (A stressed syllable after the bottom.)
4.  A: `What's the `matter with you?
    B: I've had a `sleepless `night.
5   A: `Who is that `man?
    B: He's a rep'orter.
    A: I'don't like his `looks.
    B: I'll `send  him a`way, then.
6   A: I'd `like to have a `word with you.
    B: Just `leave me a `lone
    A: `Give me a `chance to ex'plain things.
    B: I'm `not `intersted. `Go a`way.

Exercise 7


1  A: I'm leaving tonight.
   B: When will you return?
2  A: It's rather dark in here.
   B: Switch on the light then.
3  A: You must complete it by Wednesday.
   B: I don't think I can.
4. A: We're going to the zoo tomorrow.
   B: That's splendid!
5. A: Which one d'you want?
   B: I'll have this one.
   A: This one's taken already
   B: Then I don't want any.

The Rising Tone

When we use a rising tone on the nucleus, the pitch starts at a 
low level and keeps on rising till the end of the group. 
We shall indicate this tone with a slanting mark pointing upward, 
placed at the bottom of the line before the nucleus.

This tone is generally used in

a)	questions that demand an answer in yes or no;
    	for example.
    	1	`Have they gone?
   	2	`Will he a'gree?
   	3	 D'you, know them?

b)	incomplete utterances which form part of a sentence, quite often subordinate
    	clauses. For example.
    	1	`It it, rains/we'll `go by `taxi.
    	2	Al `though she was, ill. /she `took her e`xam.
    	3	It's `time for the , lecture/but 'no one has `come
   	4	By the `time I, got there/it was al'ready `dark
    	5	I'd `take you `sightseeing/if I'had the, time

c)  	wh-questions which are said in a warm friendly way:
    	for example.
    	1	`What's your, name? (to a small child)
    	2 	`How's your, mother?

d)  	polite requests or encouraging invitations:
    	for example.
    	1  	`Could I `borrow your ,pen?
    	2  	`Please' pour me some, water?
    	3   	`Do come, in.

e)  	alternative questions: for example.
    	1  	Would you like ,tea./,coffee,/or a `soft drink?
    	2  	Shall we, walk/or'go by `bus?

Exercise 18

Look at the following phrases and sentences and listen to them on the cassette. 
They are all said with the rising tone on the nucleus. Practise saying them with 
the correct intonation.

1	`Don't ,bother.
2     I'm `so, sorry.
3     `See you, soon.
4     `Good , bye.
5     `Come again, soon.
6.    Let me `know how you get, on.
7     `Don't for'get to, write

Exercise 19

Now look at these longer utterances in which the nucleus has the rising tone. 
Listen to them and practise saying them. Make sure the pitch of your 
voice moves on the nucleus from a lower level to a higher level.

1	Have you `heard the `latest, news?
2     Did you re'member to `lock the `front, door?
3     Are you `sure you can'do it your, self?
4     Would you `like another `slice of, bread?

Exercise 20

Here  are sentences that have two tone groups. 
In the first tone group the nucleus has the rising tone and
in the second tone group the nucleus has the falling tone. 
Notice that the main clause is generally said with the falling tone 
and the dependent clause with the rising tone. Listen to these sentences 
and practise saying them aloud.

1	`If I am, late/`don't `wait for me.
2  	As `soon as you `finish your/ homework/you can'go out and`play
3  	Al'though they are `very, poor/ they are ex'tremely `honest.
4  	`After we've `had our, dinner/we'll `go for a `walk.
5  	At the `bottom of the, shelf/ you'll find my `dictionary.

Exercise 21

The following short dialogues will give you more practice in the use of the rising tone.

Listen to them and then read them aloud.

1 A: `Shall I `write it, down?
  B: `If you, like.
2 A: Did you `say you were `leaving to, night?
  B: `That's, right.
3 A: Can I `have a, word with you?
  B: `Please come, in.
4 A: I'll see you `off at the `airport.
  B: `Don't, bother
5 A: `Will you be `staying there, long?
  B: `Not if I can, help it.
6 A: D'you `mind' counting those, sheets?
  B: ,One/, two/, three/, four/, five/, six/, seven/, eight/, nine.

Exercise: 22



1 A:	Have you answered the letter?
  B:  Yes, I have.
2 A:  Shall I answer the door?
  B:  If you don't mind.
3 A:  Is anything the matter?
  B:  I've failed the exam.
  A:  Give it another try.
  B:  I don't think I can ever succeed.
  A:  I'm sure you can.
4 A:  Are you leaving today?
  B:  Yes, I'll be away for three months.
  A:  Let me know how you get on.

Exercise 23

As we have said, yes no questions are normally said with a rising intonation. 
Invitations that are expressed in the form of yes-no questions are 
therefore to be said with the rising tone. Listen to these bits of 
dialogue and then say them as marked.

1   I (Invitation) : Would you `like to' come to dinner to, night?
    R (Response) : I'd`love to.
2   I: Would you `like to' go to a, concert next week?
    R: `Yes, /, thanks, I I'd love  to.
3   I: Would you `like to' go to a party this week, end?
    R: I'd `love to.
4   I: Would you `like to go, shopping to, morrow?
    R: Yes./, thanks, I'd `love to.
5   I: D'you `feel like `going to a,  movie this, evening?
    R: I'd `love to.

Exercise 24

This time you should pay attention not only to the expressions used for 
inviting people but also to the different expressions used in accepting the invitations. 
Say each sentence as marked.

1  I (Invitation): W're `going for a `picnic this, Sunday.
     Would you `like to, join us?
   R (response): `Yes./, thanks./I'd love to.
2  I: We're `having a `party this week, end.
      We'd like you to `come.
   R: That's `very' kind of you./Thank you.
3  I: We're going to the `take this, evening.
      Can you, come?
