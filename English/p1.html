<h3><u>The Simple Present</u></h3>
<ol>
<li>The Simple Present Tense is used for 
permanent truths,habitual actions and states.


It is found with such adverbs as these:

always,often,frequently,rarely,
generally,sometimes,usually 

and such adverbial phrases as:

Every day (week,month),
Once(twice,several times) a week(month)

and time clauses beginning with:

Whenever,every time that....


it is generally not used with adverbs 
of present time,such as:
at the moment,at present.

Examples:


She often rests after lunch.
He visits the hospital several times a month.
They go to the theatre whenever they can.


<li>Alex is a bus driver but now he is in bed asleep.
so he is not driving a bus

(He is asleep)

but he drives a bus.

(He is a bus driver) 


Nurses look after patients in hospitals.




<li>we use the present simple in 
sentences like this
I suggest,I promise,I insist,I apologise,I recommend

I promise I won't be late
(not 'I promising')

What do you suggest I do ?
I suggest that you


It is a nice day.I suggest we go out for a week

I wont't tell anybody what you said I promise

(in a restaurent)
You must let me pay for the meal I insist

I apologise for what I said about you.
It wasn't true and I shouldn't have said it.

The new restaurent in hill street is very good.
I recommend it.

<li>We use the present simple 
when we say how often we do things

I get up at 8 O'clock every morning.

How often do you go to the dentist?
(Not 'How often are you going')

Ann doesn't drink tea very often.

In summer John usually plays tennis once or twice a week.

<li>There are a number of common verbs 
which we do not often use in the
continuous tenses.Although we may 
be using them for describing an action
at the moment of speaking,we use 
the simple tense.

The reason why they are generally 
used in the simple tense 
is that the actions they 
describe are ones which cannot be 
stopped or started at will;they 
are more or less involuntary 
actions or states.

These are the principal verbs of this type:


smell,hear,see,notice(sensations)
think,believe,know,remember,forget,
suppose,understand,
(mental processes)

Want,wish,desire,need(desires)
like,dislike,love,hate,detest,prefer,
mind(=object to)
(likes and dislikes)

seem,appear,resemble,look(=appear)(appearance),
mean,matter,consist of,
belong to,contain

I hear what you are saying.
I believe he is coming tomorrow.
His behaviour really seems extraordinary.
I don't mind your going if you want to.
what does this box contain?


when the progressive form is used ,
it refers to sth that is continuous over
a much longer period

I am hearing much better since 
I had that operation

You're seeing things(i.e suffering from hallucinations)

He was smelling at the bottle(i.e sniffing),
to try and find out what had been in it.



feel when it means (experience a sensation)

feel cold,feel sick,feel ill,feel better,feel sad

think when it means (be of the opinion)
use the simple form of the present even 
for a specific occasion

I feel tired.I feel sick.I feel better today.
I think you are wrong

The progressive is possible,though 
it usually suggests that the state 
is temporary

I am feeling tired.I am feeling hungry.

I did not feel very well yesterday,
but I am feeling better today






<li>In the same way as a Future Simple idea 
is expressed by the 
Present Simple in time clauses,
so a future perfect idea is expressed 
by the Present Perfect.

Time Clauses
(Conjuctions of time)
After,as,as soon as,before,immediately,till/untill,
when,whenever,while,since,the sooner,
hardly....when,no sooner.......than.

This means that he will come just 
at the beginning of the play.
He wouldn't come till the play has begun.
This means that he will arrive after 
the beginning.(Future Perfect Idea)
