<h3><u>Finite verb and Infinite verb</u></h3>
<ol>
<li>They always find fault with me.
<h4>The verb find has they for its subject;
hence the verb find is limited 
by person and number.</h4>
<li>They always try to find fault with me.

<h4><i>To find</i> merely <i>names</i> the action denoted by
the verb <i>find</i>
and is used without mentioning any subject.
It is,therefore,not limited by person and 
number as a verb that has a subject,
and is,therefore,
called the verb Infinite,
or simply the infinitive.
