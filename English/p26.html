<h1>Get instead of become</h1>
<h4>
This use of get is very common.
There is an interesting development 
of this in the passive voice,
where the verb get replaces be usually
to stress the moment of action rather
than the resultant state.

(owing to the frequent use of 
past participles
as adjectives, 
the ordinary passive construction
can't always make it clear 
whether action or state is meant.)
