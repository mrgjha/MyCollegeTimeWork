<h3><u>Present Progressive</u></h3>
<ol>
<li>All or any time,e.g

The ganga is always flowing into the sea.-
The activity is uncompleted as it never stops.
It uses adverbials,like,always,constantly,
for ever.

<li>The Present period

Where do you live ? (Permanently)
Where are you living ? (Temporarily)

If we say, 'Mohan is going to the college now'
It does not mean that now he is on his 
way to the college.
It simply means that he is a college 
student now

<li>The present moment

Charles is going to the University at this moment.
Here 'going' can not be replaced by 'goes'

We can also refer to activities in progress,as in:-

while I mam cooking this omelette,Mary is
 arranging dish.
-Here We emphasize the uncompleted nature 
of both activities.

In the following sentence both are 
uncompleted activities 
but the speaker is focussing his 
attention on the gradual 
progress of the procession:-

As I stand here the procession 
is entering the hall.


<li>Future time in conditional classes
The police will not take your car away 
if you are sitting in it.


<li>Immediate past time,as in

A-I don't believe what you've just said.
B-You do believe it.You Know 
I am telling the truth.

<li>Past time:-

The speaker here refers to the activity that 
is in the background
of new development in a narrative:-

While marry is standing up on the coach 
looking back at his father,the horses 
suddenly back into a gallop.
