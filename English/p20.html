<ol>
<li>The phone has been ringing for 
five minutes.
I wish somebody would answer it.
<li>I wish you would do something 
instead of just sitting and doing nothing.

<h4>You can use I wish ..wouldn't 
to complain about things 
people do repeatedly.
</h4>

<li>I wish you wouldn't keep interrupting me.

<h4>We use I wish....would 
for actions and changes,
not situations

<h5>It is dreadful having to share a room with Bernie.
He's so untidy.His books are all over the place,
He never washes his coffee cup,He leaves dirty
clothes around the room-It is such 
a mess I can't work
And he comes in late in the evening when 
I am trying to sleep
and lies in bed watching television.
I can't stand it.</h5>


<h4>Martin</h4>


<li>I Wish He would wash his coffe cup.
<li>I wish he wouldn't leave dirty clothes
around the room
<li>I wish he wouldn't come in late.
<li>I wish he wouldn't lie in bed watching television.


<h5>The trouble with Martin is that he never relaxes.
He 's always working and he's always bad tempered.
He doesn't tell me what is wrong,he just sulks.
And he interferes with my possessions.
He moves my books around so I can't find them</h5>


<h4>Bernie</h4>

<li>I wish he would tell me what is wrong
<li>I wish he wouldn't sulk
<li>I wish he wouldn't interfere with my possessions
<li>I wish he wouldn't move my books around.
