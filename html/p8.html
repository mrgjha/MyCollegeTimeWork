The main difference between XML and HTML
• XML was designed to carry data.
• XML is not a replacement for HTML.
XML and HTML were designed with different
goals:
– XML was designed to describe data and to focus on
what data is.
HTML was designed to display data and to focus on
how data looks.
– HTML is about displaying information, while XML is
about describing information.



XML does not DO anything

XML was not designed to DO anything.
Maybe it is a little hard to understand, but XML does not DO anything. XML was created to
structure, store and to send information.
The following example is a note to Tove from Jani, stored as XML:
&lt;note&gt;
&lt;to&gt;Tove&lt;/to&gt;
&lt;from&gt;Jani&lt;/from&gt;
&lt;heading&gt;Reminder&lt;/heading&gt;
&lt;body&gt;Don't forget me this weekend!&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/note&gt;
The note has a header and a message body. It also has sender and receiver information. But
still, this XML document does not DO anything. It is just pure information wrapped in
XML tags. Someone must write a piece of software to send, receive or display it.


XML is free and extensible


• XML tags are not predefined. You must "invent" your
own tags.
• The tags used to mark up HTML documents and the
structure of HTML documents are predefined. The author
of HTML documents can only use tags that are defined in
the HTML standard (like &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;, etc.).
• XML allows the author to define his own tags and his own
document structure.
• The tags in the example above (like &lt;to&gt; and &lt;from&gt;) are
not defined in any XML standard. These tags are
"invented" by the author of the XML document.

XML is a complement to HTML


• XML is not a replacement for HTML.
• It is important to understand that XML is not a
replacement for HTML. In future Web
development it is most likely that XML will be
used to describe the data, while HTML will be
used to format and display the same data.
• My best description of XML is this: XML is a
cross-platform, software and hardware
independent tool for transmitting information.
