What is XML?
• XML stands for EXtensible Markup Language
• XML is a markup language much like HTML
• XML was designed to describe data
• XML tags are not predefined. You must define
your own tags
• XML uses a Document Type Definition (DTD)
or an XML Schema to describe the data
• XML with a DTD or XML Schema is designed to
be self-descriptive




XSL


• XSL stands for eXtensible Stylesheet
Language.
• The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
started to develop XSL because there was a
need for an XML based Stylesheet
Language.


CSS - HTML Style Sheets


• HTML uses predefined tags and the
meanings of tags are well understood.
• The &lt;table&gt; element defines a table and a
browser knows how to display it.
• Adding styles to HTML elements is also
simple. Telling a browser to display an
element in a special font or color, is easily
done with CSS.

XSL - XML Style Sheets


• XML does not use predefined tags (we can use
any tags we like) and the meanings of these tags
are not well understood.
• The &lt;table&gt; could mean an HTML table or a piece
of furniture, and a browser does not know how to
display it.
• There must be something in addition to the XML
document that describes how the document should
be displayed; and that is XSL!
