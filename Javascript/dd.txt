Sending Mail is very easy in ASP.NET. Before you run this program you need to do some settings in SMTP server. 

Plz open IIS--> SMTP --> Properties-->Access Tab-->Click Relay Button-->Select Only the List below Radio Button and then Press Add Button-->Select Single User Radio button and then enter IP address as 127.0.0.1-->Click OK and Apply.

Once you do all the settings above then run the asp.net program. Then it works perfectly. Remeber you must do the above settings. If it won't work plz e-mail me.
