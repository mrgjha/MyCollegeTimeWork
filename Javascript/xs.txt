The DataGrid control has built-in support for paging through the records of a data source.
For example, there may be a large number of records in the AccountsTable. If we divide the records 
into multiple pages, it is convenient for the user to see the data. 
We enable paging for a DataGrid by enabling the AllowPaging property and 
creating a subroutine to change the current page. 

This example displays five records at a time from the AccountsTable. By clicking the 
< and > links displayed at the bottom of the DataGrid, 
we can navigate forward or backward. A new page is selected 
with the drdaccounts_pageIndexChanged subroutine. 
This subroutine assigns the value of the NewPageIndex to the DataGrid control's CurrentPageIndex. 
The subroutine then rebinds the DataGrid to the data source, displaying the new page of records.
