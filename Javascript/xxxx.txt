The Search Engine module will search an entire page also dynamic pages for matching keyword(s) or a phrase and will count how many times the keyword(s)or phrase are found on the page, and display the results with the highest matches first. The module will search all files with the extensions that you can easily place the extension name into the web.config file where indicated. Files or folders that you don't want searched can be placed in the web.config where indicated, so these files and folders are not searched.
Note: It is best suited for small sites. Also you can modify this code to crawl pages internally by using regular expressions. For larger site you will need to write to XML file once periodically and then read from XML file.
