Title: Error 404 Auto-Redirect / Suggestion Page
Description: The code takes in a standard 404 error, parses the directory that the missing file was in and then shows a list of alternate pages to the end user. IE if a user went to /indx.asp, the code would provide a link to /index.asp. 
Alternatively, this script can auto-redirect the user to the correct page. In the above example, the user would simply be redirected to /index.asp seamlessly.
Suggested files can be limited by extension (inclusion and exclusion), and can be told not to suggest specific files (such as robots.txt or any private information).
It is highly suggested that you include header and footer files to customize the look of the page. see a live example at: http://www.arathreel.com/angl.txt
note that you MUST have administrative access to IIS to use this.
