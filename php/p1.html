PHP is a server-side scripting language 
designed specifically for the Web. 
Within an HTML page, 
you can embed PHP code that will be executed 
each time the page is visited. 
Your PHP code is interpreted at 
the Web server and generates HTML 
or other output that the visitor will see” 

1994: Created by Rasmis Lesdorf, software engineer (part of Apache Team)
1995: Called Personal Home Page Tool, 
then released as version 2 with name PHP/FI 
(Form Interpreter, to analyze SQL queries)

Half 1997: used by 50,000 web sites
October 1998: used by 100,000 websites
End 1999: used by 1,000,000 websites



Open-source
Easy to use ( C-like and Perl-like syntax)
Stable and fast
Multiplatform
Many databases support
Many common built-in libraries
Pre-installed in Linux distributions


To use or assign variable $ must be present 
before the name of the variable
The assign operator is '='
There is no need to declare the type of the variable 
the current stored value produces an 
implicit type-casting of the variable.
A variable can be used before to be assigned 



$A = 1;
$B = “2”;
$C = ($A + $B); // Integer sum
$D = $A . $B; // String concatenation
echo $C; // prints 3
echo $D;//  prints 12

Function isset tests if a variable is assigned or not
$A = 1;
if (isset($A))
print “A isset”
if (!isset($B))
print “B is NOT set”;

Using $$
$help = “hiddenVar”;
$$help = “hidden Value”;
echo $$help; // prints  hidden Value
$$help = 10;
$help = $$help * $$help;
echo $help; // print 100
		
A string is a sequence of chars
	$stringTest = “this is a sequence of chars”;
	echo $stringTest[0]; output: t
	echo $stringTest; output: this is a sequence of chars
A single quoted strings is displayed “as-is”
	$age = 37;
	$stringTest = 'I am $age years old'; // output: I am $age years old
	$stringTest = “I am $age years old”; // output: I am 37 years old
Concatenation
	$conc = ”is “.”a “.”composed “.”string”;
	echo $conc; // output: is a composed string
	$newConc = 'Also $conc '.$conc;
	echo $newConc; // output: Also $conc is a composed string



 Explode function
	$sequence = “A,B,C,D,E,F,G”;
	$elements = explode (“,”,$sequence);
	// Now elements is an array with all substrings between “,” char
	echo $elemets[0]; // output: A;
	echo $elemets[1]; // output: B;
	echo $elemets[2]; // output: C;
	echo $elemets[3]; // output: D;
	echo $elemets[4]; // output: E;
	echo $elemets[5]; // output: F;
	echo $elemets[6]; // output: G;
