Rules of Debit and Credit


The two sides of any account are arbitrarily distinguished. 
The left side of an account is 
called the debit side; 
the right side is called the credit side.
An entry on the left side of an account 
is called a debit entry, or merely a debit,
An entry on the right side is called a credit 
entry or credit.
The act of recording an entry on the left side of an account 
is called debiting the account; and 
recording an entry on the right side of an account 
is called crediting the account. The 
difference between the total debits and total credits 
is the account balance.


  



From the following transactions, state the nature of
accounts and state which account will be 
debited and which account will be credited?
