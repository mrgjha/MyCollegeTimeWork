<h3>DAO, RDO, ODBC, ADO, ODBC, OLEDB</h3>
<p align="left">
Database Access in Visual Basic is an ocean of terminology. The terms we will define here are Jet, ISAM, OLEDB, ODBC, DAO, RDO and ADO.</p>


<h3>Jet, ISAM, ODBC, OLEDB</h3>

<p align="left">
If your Visual Basic program connects to Access databases, it uses a layer of translators called the Jet engine. The Jet Engine, with various limitations can also communicate with: Paradox, dBase.<br>
If your Visual Basic program needs to connect to other databases, enter ODBC.
</p>


<h3>DAO, RDO, ADO</h3>
<p align="left">

First point. These are different ways to accomplish exactly the same task. They all three can open and manipulate databases.</p>
<p align="left">
DAO is Microsoft's first object structure/code library to manipulate databases. Invented in Access 1, Draft 2 in Access 1.1, Draft 3 in Access 2.0, Draft 4 in Access 95 and VB4, Draft 5 in Access 97 and VB5.... Many DAO commands that have been retained for backward compatibility can make the syntax quite ugly at times.</p>
<p align="left">
DAO code assumes database is local and while it can deal with ODBC data (Oracle, DB2, SQL Server, Paradox, FoxPro) it has no special facilities for dealing with the data. It won't break with non-local data, but you can't get certain things that make sense with remote data done.
</p>

<h3>DAO (Data Access Objects)</h3>
<pre>
DAO Code to open database and print message book of first field looks like this:

Dim wstemp As Workspace
Dim dbtemp As Database
Dim rstemp As Recordset
' if your data is ODBC, uncomment this line below for speed
' DBEngine.DefaultType = dbUseODBC
Set wstemp = DBEngine.Workspaces(0)
Set dbtemp = wstemp.OpenDatabase _
    ("", dbrivernoprompt, False, "DSN= ;UID= ;PWD= ;")
                                ^    ^    ^
Set rstemp = dbtemp.OpenRecordset _
(myquery.Text)
howmany = 0
Combo1.Clear
Do Until rstemp.EOF
msgbox rstemp(0)
rstemp.MoveNext
howmany = howmany + 1
Loop

RDO Code to do the same looks like this:

Dim contemp As New rdoConnection
Dim rstemp As rdoResultset
Dim envtemp As rdoEnvironment
Set envtemp = rdoEngine.rdoEnvironments(0)
envtemp.CursorDriver = rdUseServer
' or rdUseOdbc, rdUseNone, rdUseIfNeeded, rdUseClientBatch
With contemp
  .Connect = "DSN= ;UID= ;PWD= ;"
                ' ^     ^     ^
  .EstablishConnection rdDriverNoPrompt, false, rdoForwardOnly
  ' or rdoStatic, rdoKeyset, rdoDynamic
End With


Set rstemp = contemp.OpenResultset(" ")
' ^ Your SQL here
End If

howmany = 0
With rstemp
Do Until .EOF Or howmany > 2000
msgbox .rdoColumns(0)
' Give a message box of the 1st column
.MoveNext
howmany = howmany + 1
Loop
</pre>

<h3>DAO vs. RDO Queries and Client/Server</h3>
<p align="left">
DAO is automatic and RDO is stick shift. There are 100 parameters you can
adjust about a RDO conversation with a database that have no counterpart in
DAO. Major Difference:
</p>

<p align="left">

DAO Queries, i.e. here is pseudocode
<ol>
<li>DAO setup code
<li>open database
<li>execute query that adds, updates or deletes
<li>do next step
</ol></p>

<p align="left">
Line 4 will not execute until Line 3's Query request has been fulfilled.
And if the query takes 10 seconds on the server, the client is idle and
will not go to Step 4 until the server says I'm done or generates a runtime
error (maybe the data is faulty or query is bad).
</p>
<p align="left">
RDO is different<ol>
<li>RDO setup code
<li>open database
<li>execute query that adds, updates or deletes
<li>do next step
</ol>
</p>

<p align="left">
Step 4 happens almost instantly after Step3 in RDO. On the other hand the server will not bring your program down with a runtime error, you have to explicitly check some Error/status objects to see if it's complete,a nd if 5 or 6 queries are all executing on the server, there will be 5 or 6 different successes, failures or "still executing" values to check in the Error/Status objects while they are running. More complex than DAO but extremely useful in a C/S app.</p>

New Technology: ADO
<p align="left">
Designed as a replacment for DAO and RDO. RDO and DAO will always work in
VB for backwards compatibility, but Microsoft wants this simpler model they
invented that is easier than DAO and RDO and almost as powerful as RDO. VB can use ADO</p>
<pre>
dim conn as ADODB.Connection
dim rs as recordset
Conn.Open "...", "...", "..."
'           ^DSN   ^User  ^Password
Set RS = Conn.Execute( "SELECT * FROM theTable" )
do while not rs.eof
   msgbox RS(i).Value<% Next %>
   rs.movenext
loop
</p>
