“On-line interactive communities... will be communities not of common location, but of common interest.... the total number of users...will be large enough to support extensive general purpose [computers]. All of these will be interconnected by telecommunications channels... [to] constitute a labile network of networks--ever changing in both content and configuration.”
J. C. R. Licklider
