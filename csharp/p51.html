<h3>Why .Net and C# </h3>

<p align="left">

Perhaps you've invested a great deal of time learning and understanding particular programming languages and environments and are now you are faced with learning yet more. Or perhaps, you're starting out and trying to decide what to study. I've seen many programming languages come into common use and then fade out. It's the nature of computer science that as the requirements change and as hardware becomes enhanced, the nature of software also changes. I've seen software move from being procedural to being based on objects interacting in complex ways. Procedural software made sense when machines were slow and memory was limited. It was fast and direct. As hardware became able to support more, object-oriented programming offered elegant and more robust solutions to more detailed problems. The move from client-server based architectures to multiteer and web-based architectures has also influenced how software is designed and constructed. Client-server architecture made sense given the configuration and limits of networks during its heyday. As the Internet has expanded, the need to deliver services and information via browser-based applications and web services has expanded. Again, this is an example of software growing to match the available hardware. Given the rapid pace of change in software and the limited time available for anyone to devote to study, the crucial question is what should you learn.

As choices for developing applications (programs) that have the ability to deliver solutions and services in a world linked by the Internet, two main choices have arisen. On non-Windows platforms, such as Unix and Linux, Java has emerged as the choice for developing web based solutions and services. .Net and its main languages, C# and Visual Basic, offer the same possibilities on Windows. Java also functions on Windows. This raises the questions of this thesis, why .Net and why C#. .Net and its languages offer real advantages over Java as a choice for application development on Windows platforms. I offer this statement as someone who cut their teeth on Unix systems using GNU compilers and tools from the Free Software Foundation. For those of you not among the retro-grouch crowd populated by many of the developers I know, this means that by inclination, I am skeptical and resistant to anything coming out of Redmond. Despite this inclination, I am forced to conclude that .Net is the environment of choice for developing solutions on Windows.</p>

Briefly, here are several features of .Net that make a suitable and robust environment for application development on supported platforms, currently Windows. We'll explore each of these points in detail in the next few lessons of this tutorial.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Cross Language Support<br>
All .Net languages are based on the same underlying type system. This means that code written in one .Net language can easily use and integrate with code written in other .Net languages. .Net languages include C#, Visual Basic.Net and managed C++. 
<li>Use of Common Internet protocols.<br>
.Net offers extensive support for XML, which is the choice for formatting information over the Internet. Additionally, support for transfer via SOAP is also integrated. 
<li>Use of Metadata within Assemblies.<br>
.Net components (Executables and libraries in C++ lingo) are deployed as part of assemblies. Each assembly contains metadata that allows simple assembly versioning, simpler reflection to determine assemble content and capabilities and component based security. These are real advantages over what Java offers and we will explore them in detail. 
<li>Simple Deployment<br>
The metadata in assemblies also simplifies deployment. An assembly can specify exactly the location and version of any other code it needs. The problems of maintaining a registry such as that needed with .COM components and the problems of DLL version mismatch have been eliminated. 
<li>Type Checking<br>
The CLR, common language runtime, type checks all objects in use. All objects are derived from an object class, similar to what is done in Java. 
<li>Memory Management and Garbage Collection<br>
The CLR also handles memory allocation and garbage collection. Garbage collection is the automatic reclaiming of memory from objects that are no longer in scope. The memory management nightmares of C++ are gone.
