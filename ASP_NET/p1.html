ASP.NET is the latest version of 
Microsoft's Active Server Pages technology (ASP).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What you should already know
Before you continue you should have a basic 
understanding of the following:

WWW, HTML and the basics of building Web pages 
Scripting languages like JavaScript or VBScript 
The basics of server side scripting 
If you want to study these subjects first, 
find the tutorials on our Home Page


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is ASP?

ASP is a server side scripting technology 
that enables scripts (embedded in web pages) 
to be executed by an Internet server.

ASP is a Microsoft Technology 
ASP stands for Active Server Pages 
ASP is a program that runs inside IIS 
IIS stands for Internet Information Services 
IIS comes as a free component with Windows 2000 
IIS is also a part of the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack 
The Option Pack can be downloaded from Microsoft 
PWS is a smaller - but fully functional - version of IIS 
PWS can be found on your Windows 95/98 CD 
What is an ASP File?
An ASP file is just the same as an HTML file 
An ASP file can contain text, HTML, XML, and scripts 
Scripts in an ASP file are executed on the server 
An ASP file has the file extension ".asp" 


How Does it Work?
When a browser requests an HTML file, 
the server returns the file 
When a browser requests an ASP file, 
IIS passes the request to the ASP engine 
on the server 
The ASP engine reads the file, line by line, 
and executes the scripts in the file 
Finally, the ASP file is returned to the browser 
as plain HTML 
Before you study ASP .NET, it would help to have 
a basic understanding of Microsoft's ASP technology. 

To learn more about ASP, you can study our ASP tutorial.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is ASP+?
ASP+ is the same as ASP.NET.
ASP+ is just an early name used by Microsoft 
when they developed ASP.NET.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is ASP.NET?
ASP 3.0 is the latest version of ASP, 
but there will never be an ASP 4.0 version.
ASP.NET is the next generation ASP, but 
it's not an upgraded version of ASP. ASP.NET 
is an entirely new paradigm for server-side 
ASP scripting.
ASP.NET is a part of the .NET Framework. 
Microsoft spent three years rewriting ASP.NET 
from the ground up, 
and ASP.NET is not fully backward compatible 
with ASP 3.0.
You can read more about the differences between 
ASP and ASP.NET 
in the next chapter of this tutorial.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.NET Framework
The .NET Framework is the infrastructure for the 
Microsoft .NET platform. 
The .NET Framework is an environment for building, 
deploying, and running Web applications and Web Services.
The .NET Framework contains a common language runtime 
and common class libraries - like ADO.NET, 
ASP.NET and 
Windows Forms - to provide advanced 
standard services 
that can be integrated into a variety 
of computer systems.
The .NET Framework provides a feature-rich 
application environment, 
simplified development and easy integration between 
a number of different development languages. 
The .NET Framework is language neutral. 
Currently it supports C++, 
C#, Visual Basic, and JScript 
(Microsoft's version of JavaScript).
Microsoft's Visual Studio.NET is a common 
development environment 
for the .NET Framework.




ASP .NET has better language support, 
a large set of new controls and XML based components, 
and better user authentication.
ASP .NET provides increased performance 
by running compiled code.
ASP .NET code is not fully backward 
compatible with ASP.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in ASP .NET
Better language support 
Programmable controls 
Event-driven programming 
XML-based components 
User authentication, with accounts and roles 
Higher scalability 
Increased performance - Compiled code 
Easier configuration and deployment 
Not fully ASP compatible 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Language Support
ASP .NET uses the new ADO .NET.
ASP .NET supports full Visual Basic, not VBScript.
ASP .NET supports C# (C sharp) and C++.
ASP .NET supports JScript as before.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ASP .NET Controls
ASP .NET contains a large set of HTML controls. 
Almost all HTML elements on a page can be defined as 
ASP .NET control objects that can be controlled by scripts.
ASP .NET also contains a new set of object 
oriented input controls, 
like programmable list boxes and validation controls.
A new data grid control supports sorting, 
data paging, 
and everything you expect from a dataset control.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Event Aware Controls
All ASP .NET objects on a Web page can expose events 
that can be processed by ASP .NET code.
Load, Click and Change events handled by code makes 
coding much simpler and much better organized.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ASP .NET Components
ASP .NET components are heavily based on XML. 
Like the new AD Rotator, that uses XML 
to store advertisement 
information and configuration.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

User Authentication
ASP .NET supports forms-based user authentication, 
including cookie management and automatic 
redirecting of unauthorized logins.
(You can still do your custom login page 
and custom user checking).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

User Accounts and Roles
ASP .NET allows for user accounts and roles, 
to give each user (with a given role) access 
to different server code and executables.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

High Scalability
Much has been done with ASP .NET to provide 
greater scalability.
Server to server communication has been 
greatly enhanced, 
making it possible to scale an application 
over several servers. 
One example of this is the ability to 
run XML parsers, 
XSL transformations and even resource hungry 
session objects on other servers.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compiled Code
The first request for an ASP .NET page 
on the server will 
compile the ASP .NET code and keep 
a cached copy in memory. 
The result of this is greatly 
increased performance.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Easy Configuration
Configuration of ASP .NET is done with 
plain text files.
Configuration files can be uploaded or 
changed while the 
application is running. 
No need to restart the server. 
No more metabase or registry puzzle.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Easy Deployment
No more server restart to deploy or 
replace compiled code. ASP .NET 
simply redirects all new requests 
to the new code.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compatibility
ASP .NET is not fully compatible with 
earlier versions of ASP, 
so most of the old ASP code will need 
some changes to run under ASP .NET.
To overcome this problem, ASP .NET uses 
a new file extension ".aspx". 
This will make ASP .NET applications 
able to run side by side with standard 
ASP applications on the same server.
