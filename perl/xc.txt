Advanced Javascript Plugins provides you a very easy way to perform special tasks directly in JavaScript like sending emails, writing to files on your server, creating and managing cookies, creating personal hit counter, adding security to your pages like disabling right click, drag & drop, copy & paste, etc, and more!!! The ZIP file includes all the neccesary files (about 3 files) and a small manual on how to use all the functions and objects of the script. Please VOTE and write your comments, it would be very great, I put a lot of effort on it, Thanks :)
