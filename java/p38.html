The interface Runnable specifies only one method ,
the run() method,however,we can't use methods
like stop,sleep,getName(),...
which are member functions of the thread class


A class that implements Runnable interface works
in the same way as a class that extends Thread class

We can create an instance of that class and pass
that instance to the constructor for making a new
thread



class MyThreadRunnable implements Runnable  {
        public void run() {
                System.out.println(" this thread is running ... ");
        }
} // end class MyThread

class ThreadEx21 {
        public static void main(String [] args  ) {
                Thread t = new Thread(new MyThreadRunnable());
                            // due to implementing the Runnable interface
                           // I can call start(), and this will call run().
                t.start();
        } // end main()
}       // end class ThreadEx2
