<h3>Inheritance</h3>


In C++, a class can inherit from any 
number of classes, but Java classes can only 
extend one class. In other words, 
C++ allows multiple inheritance, but the Java 
language only allows single inheritance. 

Basically, inheritance is a way to reuse code. 
When class A inherits from, or extends, 
another class B, class A automatically 
inherits all of the public and protected 
members of class B. If class A is in the 
same package as class B, class A will also 
inherit all of the members with default, or 
package, access. It is important to note, 
however, that subclasses never inherit 
the private members of the classes they extend. 


Once you extend a class, you can add 
new fields and methods, which define the 
attributes and operations that make your 
new class distinct from the superclass. Also, 
you can override the operations of the 
superclass that must behave differently in the 
subclass. 

You can explicitly extend a class when 
you define it. 
To extend a class, you simply 
follow the name of the class with 
the extends keyword and the name of the class you 
want to extend. If you do not explicitly extend a class, 
the Java compiler will 
automatically extend the class Object. 
In this way, all Java objects are ultimately 
subclasses of class Object. 


<h3>Abstract classes </h3>

An abstract class is a class that 
cannot be instantiated. You may be wondering why 
anyone would ever want to create a class 
that you can't use to create objects. The 
answer is that you want other programmers 
to extend your class, but never create an 
instance of it. You can explicitly 
stop other programmers from instantiating your class 
by using the abstract modifier. 

You can make any ordinary class 
an abstract class, just by adding the abstract 
modifier. However, usually an abstract 
class will have one or more abstract methods. 
As you might be able to guess, 
an abstract method is a method that 
is declared, but not 
implemented, much like a C function prototype. 
When a class extends an abstract 
class, it must provide an implementation 
for each abstract method, or else it must also 
be declared as an abstract class. 
You can define an abstract method by using the 
abstract modifier. 

For example, let's define an AbstractAccount class, 
which represents a very basic 
bank account. 
The designer of this class does 
not want other programmers to use this 



<h3>Interfaces </h3>

We've already noted that a Java 
class can only extend one class. 
If you're coming from 
a background in C++, where classes 
can inherit from any number of classes, you may 
see this as extremely limiting, and you're right. 
The designers of the Java language felt 
that multiple inheritance was too complicated, 
so instead they introduced a new 
concept: interfaces. 

An interface is like an abstract class, 
with the following exceptions: 

• All interfaces are implicitly abstract, 
so you don't need to use the abstract 
keyword. Methods defined in an interface 
are also implicitly abstract, so you don't 
need to use the abstract keyword for methods. 
If you try to declare a method with 
a body in an interface, you'll get a compile-time error. 

· All members of an interface are implicitly public. 
· All fields defined in an interface are implicitly static and final. 
· An interface cannot be instantiated, so an interface does not define a constructor. 


An interface is declared just like a class, 
except the interface keyword is used 
instead of the class keyword. 
An interface can extend any number of 
superinterfaces. Methods inside an interface cannot 
include an implementation. 
Interface methods are simply method definitions; 
they do not have bodies.
