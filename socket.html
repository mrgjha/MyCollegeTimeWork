<h3><font color="blue"><u>Sockets in Java</u></font></h3>
<b>

<ul>
<li>The socket is the software abstraction used
to represent the “terminals” of a connection
between two machines.
<li>For a given connection there’s a socket on
each machine.
<ul>
<li>In Java, you create a socket to make the
connection to the other machine.
<li>Then you get an InputStream and OutputStream
from the socket in order to be able to treat the
connection as an IO stream object.
</ul>
<li>There are two stream-based socket classes:


<ul>
<li>a ServerSocket that a server uses to “listen” for incoming
connections
<li>and a Socket that a client uses in order to initiate a
connection.
</ul>

<li>Once a client makes a socket connection, the
ServerSocket returns a corresponding server side
Socket through which direct communications will take
place.
<ul>
<li>You have a true Socket to Socket connection.
<li>Use getInputStream( ) and getOutputStream( ) to produce
the corresponding InputStream and OutputStream objects
from each Socket.
<li>These must be wrapped inside buffers and formatting
classes just like any other stream object.
</ul>
<li>When you create a ServerSocket, you
give it only a port number.
<li>When you create a Socket you must
give both the IP address and the port
number where you’re trying to connect.
</ul>

<h3>A simple server and client</h3>
<ul>
<li>All the server does is wait for a connection
<ul>
<li>then uses the Socket produced by that connection to create
an InputStream and OutputStream.
</ul>
<li>Then it reads from the InputStream and it echoes to
the OutputStream until it receives the line END.
<li>The client makes the connection to the server
?? then creates an OutputStream. Lines of text are sent
through the OutputStream.
<li>The client creates an InputStream to hear what the
server is saying.
<li>Both the server and client use the same port number
and the client uses the local loopback address to
connect to the server.
</ul>



<h3>Creating URL objects</h3>
<ul><li>A Uniform Resource Locator is a pointer to a
“resource” on the web (a file, a directory, a
query to a database). It can be broken into

<ul><li>a protocol identifier and
<Li>a resource name (host name, file name, port
number, reference)</ul>
<li>A URL object can be created given
information of a URL address.
<li>URL constructors throw a
MalformedURLException if the arguments
refer to a null or unknown protocol.
</ul>

<h3>URL Constractors</h3>
<ul><li>URL(String spec)Creates a URL object from a String representation.

<ul><li>e.g. URL cs = new URL(“http://www.cs.ucy.ac.cy”)
<li>URL(URL baseURL, String relativeURL)
Creates a URL by parsing a relative URL within the
base URL context. The relative URL could be an
anchor within a file.
<li>e.g. URL epl602 = new URL(ucy,”courses/EPL602/”)
<li>URL(String protocol,String host,String file)
URL(String protocol,String host, int port,String
file)



<li>Creates an absolute URL from the specified protocol,
host name (port number) and file name
e.g. URL ucy = new URL(“http”, “www.ucy.ac.cy”, 80,
“index.html”).
</ul>

<li>The URL class provides several methods that let you
query URL objects.You can get the protocol, host
name, port number, and filename from a URL using
methods:</ul>
<li>getProtocol: Returns the protocol identifier component of
the URL.
<li>getHost: Returns the host name component of the URL.
<li>getPort: Returns the port number component of the URL (an
integer). If the port is not set returns -1.
<li>getFile: Returns the filename component of the URL.
<li>getRef: Returns the reference component of the URL.
</ul>
