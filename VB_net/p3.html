<h3>Visual Basic.Net Variables and Their Declaration</h3>

<p align="left">
The changes in variable declarations and related issues are described here.
The syntax used to declare variables has changed for VB .NET, making it more flexible. Indeed, these are long awaited changes.<br>
In VB .NET, when multiple variables are declared on the same line, if a variable is not declared with a type explicitly, then its type is that of the next variable with an explicit type declaration. Thus, in the line:<br><br><br>

Dim x As Long, i, j, k As Integer, s As String<br><br>

the variables i, j, and k have type Integer. (In VB 6, the variables i and j would have type Variant, and only the variable k would have type Integer.)<br>

When declaring external procedures using the Declare statement, VB .NET does not support the As Any type declaration. All parameters must have a specific type declaration.</p>

<h3>Variable initialization</h3>
<p align="left">
VB .NET permits the initialization of variables in the same line as their declaration (at long last). Thus, we may write:<br>

Dim x As Integer = 5<br><br>

to declare an Integer variable and initialize its value to 5. Similarly, we can declare and initialize more than one variable on a single line:<br><br>

Dim x As Integer = 6, y As Integer = 9<br><br>
</p>

<h3>Variable scope changes</h3>

<p align="left">
In VB 6, a variable that is declared anywhere in a procedure has procedure scope; that is, the variable is visible to all code in the procedure.<br>

In VB .NET, if a variable is defined inside a code block (a set of statements that is terminated by an End..., Loop, or Next statement), then the variable has block-level scope; that is, it is visible only within that block.<br>

For example, consider the following VB .NET code:<br>
<pre>
Sub Test(  )
   If x <> 0 Then
      Dim rec As Integer
      rec = 1/x
   End If
 
   MsgBox CStr(rec)
End Sub
</pre>
In this code, the variable rec is not recognized outside the block in which it is defined, so the final statement will produce an error.<br><br>

It is important to note that the lifetime of a local variable is always that of the entire procedure, even if the variable's scope is block-level. This implies that if a block is entered more than once, a block-level variable will retain its value from the previous time the code block was executed.<br><br>
