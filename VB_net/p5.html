<h3>Structure/user-defined type declarations</h3>
<ul>
<li>In VB 6, a structure or user-defined type is declared using the Type...End Type structure.
<li>In VB .NET, the Type statement is not supported.<br>Structures are declared using the Structure...End Structure construct.
<li>Also, each member of the structure must be assigned an access modifier, which can be Public, Protected, Friend, Protected Friend, or Private.
<li>(The Dim keyword is equivalent to Public in this context.)
</ul>

<pre>
For instance, the VB 6 user-defined type:

Type RECT
   Left As Long
   Top As Long
   Right As Long
   Bottom As Long
End Type

is defined in VB .NET as:

Structure RECT
   Public Left As Long
   Public Top As Long
   Public Right As Long
   Public Bottom As Long
End Structure
</pre>

Actually, the VB .NET Structure type is far more reaching than its VB 6 user-defined type predecessor. Indeed, structures have many properties in common with classes; for instance, structures can have members (properties and methods). </p>
