<h3><font color="blue"><u>Introduction to Web Page</u></font></h3>
<b>

Web pages can be either static or dynamic

A static Web page is an HTML document whose content is established at the time the page is created
<br><hr>
A dynamic Web page is interactive; it can accept information from the user and also retrieve information for the user
Whereas a static Web page is simply an HTML document, a dynamic Web page usually requires both an HTML document and a script
<br><hr>

<h3>Webpage Content</h3>
<ul>
<li>static
<ul>
<li>HTML
</ul>
<li>dynamic

<ul>
 
<li>client-side 

<ul>

<li>JavaScript
<li>VBScript


</ul>


<li>server-side

<ul>
<li>ASP
<li>PHP
<li>Perl
<li>CGI
</ul>

</ul>
</ul>

A script is a set of instructions written in a scripting language that tells a computer how to perform a task
<br><hr>
Several technologies are available for creating dynamic Web pages; examples include CGI, Active Server Pages (ASP), and Java applets

<br>
CGI, which stands for Common Gateway Interface, is the protocol that allows a Web server to communicate with CGI scripts

<ul>
<li>
mechanism for a Web browser to send data to a Web server
<li>allow browser to submit data to a program running on the server
<li>program is often called a ‘CGI script’
<li>typically written in Perl, PHP or ASP
<li>can also be a ‘real’ program (e.g. written in C)
</ul>








<br>
A CGI script is a script that follows the standards specified by the CGI protocol
The most widely used language for creating CGI scripts is Perl (Practical Extraction and Report Language)

<h3><font color="blue"><u>How the World Wide Web works</u></font></h3>

Three parts that enable a user to browse a web page:
<ul>
<li>The web server that holds the information
<li>the client that is viewing the information
<li>the protocol that connects the two entities web server
</ul>

Most popular browers (Windows):
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer
<li>Netscape Navigator
<li>Opera
<li>Mozilla
</ul>

Software Concept of Web servers:

<ul>
<li>a program that serves the files that form web pages (i.e. HTTP-, sound-,graphics- and multimedia files) to web users;
<li>following the client / server model, the web server acts as the server and the
web surfer’s web browser acts as the (remote) client, forwarding the surfer’s
requests to the web server;
<li>every web site to be published on the internet must be hosted by an online
web server;
<li>Web servers are often bundled with a larger package of internet- and intranetrelated
application programs for serving e-mail, downloading requests for File
Transfer Protocol (FTP) files etc., and building and publishing web pages.
</ul>


The HTTP Protocol
A HTTP(HyperText Transfer Protocol)message consists of
<ul>
<li>request / response line
<li>HTTP header
<li>HTTP body
</ul>
HTTP Protocol

<ul>
<li>request line
<li>header
<li>body
</ul>

<ul>
<li>response line
<li>header
<li>body
</ul>

The HTTP Request
<ul>
<li>Request line
<li>an HTTP command known as method
<li>the path to the server to the resource that the client is requesting
<li>the version number of HTTP
</ul>



<ul>
<h3>get</h3>

<li>The information required by the request can be anything from an
HTML page to a JavaScript source file. Data can be sent to the
browser, in the form of an extension to the URL.
<h3>head</h3>
<li>This is similar to the get method; indicates a request for the header only
<h3>post</h3>
<li>data will be sent to the server as part of the HTTP body

</ul>

<h3>The HTTP Protocol: Request</h3>
<ul>
<li>Request line (...)
<li>The HTTP Header
<li>The HTTP Body contains data that is being sent to the server
</ul>
<h3>The HTTP Response<br>
The Response Line requires three items of information:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The HTTP version number
<li>An HTTP request code that reports the success or failure of the request
<li>A short message describing the status of the request
</ul>
<pre>
<h3>The HTTP Protocol: Response<br>
HTTP Request Codes</h3>
denote a server error – request appeared to be valid,
but the server failed to carry it out(500-599)


denote a client error – the request was incomplete,
incorrect, or imposible(400-499)

the request has not been performed(300-399)
denote succes(200-299)
indicates that the request is currently beeing processed(100-199)

</pre>

<h3>The HTTP Protocol: Response</h3>
<ul>
<li>The HTTP Header
<li>The HTTP Body contains the HTML code, image data etc.
</ul>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<ul>
<li>remember preferences using cookies
<li>Cookies are useful for storing user info that should be retained from one page to the next.
<li>Cookies are written to the client’s hard drive.
<li>developed by Netscape but widely adopted
<li>typically, cookies are only shared with the server that set them
<li>support for cookies in Perl, PHP and ASP
</ul>
