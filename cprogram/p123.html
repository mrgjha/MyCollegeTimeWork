<h3>File Pointers</h3>
<h5>

A file pointer works like a bookmark. 
It essentially helps in accessing any required 
position in the file. 
Four functions namely,
 
seekg(), 
seekp(), 
tellg(), 
and tellp() 

help in this regard. Two pointers: 
get_pointer and put_pointer 
maintained for every file help in 
attaining random access in a file. 
Thus without moving sequentially we can move 
to any location in the file.

Let us look at the purpose of these functions:


Function Accessed through object of class Purpose 

seekg ifstream Moves the get_pointer to given position 
seekp ofstream Moves the put _pointer to given position 
tellg ifstream Returns the current position of 
get_pointer in input file 
tellp ofstream Returns the current position of 
put_pointer in output file 

For example:
ifstream fin("text.dat");
fin.seekg(30);


will move the get_pointer to byte number 30. 
Similarly fout.seekp(30) 
will move the put_pointer to byte number 30. 
The tellg() and tellp() functions 
return the absolute 
position of the get_pointer and 
put_pointer respectively.

There is also an enumeration 
[a programmer defined data type 
somewhat similar to a structure] 
called seek_dir in iostream.h 
inside the ios class 
which enables a second form of 
these functions. 
It has the following values:


ios::beg refers to beginning of file 
ios::cur refers to current position 
ios::end refers to end of file 

Hence fin.seekg(30,ios::beg) 
positions the pointer to byte no 
30 from the beginning of the file 
and fin.seekg(-2,ios::cur) 
backs up 2 places.
Similarly fin.seekg(0,ios::end) 
goes to the end of 
the file and 
fin.seekp(-5,ios::end) 
backs up 
5 bytes from the end.
