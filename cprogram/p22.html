There is a new way to #include libraries 
(the old method still works yet the compiler roars). The .h extension is no more written and the names of 
standard C libraries are written beginning with a c. In order for the program to use 
these libraries correctly using namespace std; has to be added:



using namespace std;

#include < iostream >        // This is a key C++ library
#include < cmath >           // The standard C library math.h

int main ()

{   


    double a;   
    a = 1.2;  
    a = sin (a);  


  cout << a << endl;   return 0;


}

A few hints for beginners:

To compile this program, type it inside (or copy & paste it to)
a text editor (gedit, kwrite, kate, kedit, vi, emacs, nano, pico, mcedit, Notepad...), 
save it as a file named say test01.cpp (if you are a newbie, best put this file inside your home directory,
that is say /home/jones on a Unix-like box).

To compile this source code file, 
type this command (on most open-source Unix-like boxes) in a console or terminal window:

g++ test01.cpp -o test01

To run the binary executable file test01 that has been produced 
by the compilation (if there were no errors), type this:

./test01

Each time you modify the test01.cpp source code file, 
you need to compile it again if you want the modifications to echo in the test01 executable file 
(type the upward arrow key on your keyboard to recall commands).
