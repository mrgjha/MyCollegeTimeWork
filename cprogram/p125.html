<h5>
The first thing you need to know before
you start programming is what is the header file you require for file handling.
It is fstream.h. (fstream.h also includes the iostream.h header file so there is
no need for you to include iostream.h header file explicitly.


A file can be created in C++ through two methods:
<ol>
<li>Using the open function.
<li>Using the constructor of the stream
class.
</ol>
Files can be created using the open()
function. The only requirement is that you should know what you intend to do
with the file. The compiler must know whether you wish to read data from it,
write to it, append data to it etc.

The open function is a member of 5 classes
namely iostream, ofstream, fstream, filebuf and fstreambase. All of these
classes are defined inside the fstream.h header file. <b>The ofstream and
ifstream classes are used to write and read data to a file respectively</b>. The
fstream class can perform single-handedly both these functions provided it knows
what operation (reading, writing…) etc you wish to perform.

</h5>

#include&lt;fstream.h&gt; 

void main() 

{ 

ofstream obj1; 

obj1.open(“test.ghf”); 

obj1.close(); 

} 

<h5>

Here an object obj1 of the class ofstream
is created. When you will run the program a file by the name of test.ghf will be
created. The close function is used just to close the file objects.




If you wished to write data to the file you 
could have done so before closing it.
We will learn about this in a moment. 
The program will compile also if you 
change the word ofstream to ifstream, 
but this will mean that the compiler 
will treat the created file as one from 
which data can be read not written. 
(This will be so because obj1 will 
then become an object of the ifstream class, 
which deals with writing data only.)  
However if you change the ofstream to 
simply fstream the compiler will flag an error. 
This is because the fstream class can both enable 
reading and writing to a file and the compiler does 
not know which one you want. To specify to the compiler 
that you wish to read and write data to the file modify 
the open function as such: obj1.open(“test.ghf”,ios::in) 
for reading and obj1.open(“test.ghf”,ios::out) 
for writing data to it. 
If you wish to perform both these operations 


(ie both read and write to the file use a vertical 
bar between them to 
logically OR them together, ie: 
obj1.open (“test.ghf”,ios::in|ios::out) 

These in and out are known as mode bits. Other mode bits possible are: 
 
app            To read or write at the end of the file
ate            To erase contents of the file if it exists 
nocreate       To signal an error if the file doesn’t exist previously 
noreplace      To signal an error if the file does exist previously  
binary         To open a file in binary mode 

These mode bits can be used in the open function in any order 
by just Oring them together. For example  if you wish 
to write data to the end of a file 
in binary mode you can write: 
obj1.open(“test.ghf”,ios::out|ios::app|ios::binary); 

A point to note is that if obj1 is the object of 
the ofstream class (ie the previous line was ofstream obj1) 
then ios::out is not required. The file by default will be 
opened in the writing mode. Similarly ios::in is not required 
when your object is of the ifstream class. Opening files by 
using the constructor of the stream class is simpler. 
An example will illustrate it. 

</h5>

#include&lt;fstream.h&gt; 

void main() 

{ 

ofstream obj2(“test1.ghf”); 

obj2.close(); 

} 

<h5>
The file is created for writing. 
If you wish to open it for reading use: 
ifstream obj2(“test.ghf”); instead. 
For opening it both for reading and writing use: 

fstream obj2(“test1.ghf”,ios::in|ios::out); 

Similarly you can add more mode bits as you require.

<h5>

Suppose you wish to write a program that asks the user 
a few simple questions and then stores the data collected 
in a text file that can then be opened 
independently for viewing. The code is: 
</h5>


#include&lt;fstream.h&gt; 

#include&lt;conio.h&gt; 

#include&lt;stdio.h&gt; 

void main() 

{ 

char name[100],add[100]; 

int age; 

//This part deals with getting data from the user 

//It has nothing to do with file handling 

clrscr(); 

cout&lt;&lt;"ENTER YOUR NAME: "; 

gets(name); 

fflush(stdin); 

cout&lt;&lt;"\nENTER YOUR AGE: "; 

cin&gt;&gt;age; 

cout&lt;&lt;"\nENTER YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS: "; 

gets(add); 

fflush(stdin); 

//file handling part begins here 

ofstream file; 

file.open("biodata.txt"); 

file&lt;&lt;"BIO DATA\n"; 

file&lt;&lt;"NAME:      "&lt;&lt;name&lt;&lt;"\n"; 

file&lt;&lt;"AGE:       "&lt;&lt;age&lt;&lt;"\n"; 

file&lt;&lt;"EMAIL ADD: "&lt;&lt;add&lt;&lt;"\n"; 

file.close(); 

} 



<h5>

The part before the open function is clear. 
The user is asked for his name, age and e-mail address. 
This is stored in the variables: name, age and add. 
After that this data is written to a text file. 

Firstly a file is created using the open function. 
I use the open function because it shows a more clear 
and precise approach. You can modify the program so 
that the file is created using the constructor of the ofstream 
class if you wish but it would not make any difference. 

Now we come the statement file<<. Isn’t it similarly to 
cout<< which you must have encountered during 
your I/O programming with C++. 
The fact of the matter is that it is the same. 

Like your file object, cout is also an object. 
The difference being that it is already defined 
and you need not define it each time. 
Also the insertion operatror (<<) 
is appropriately overloaded in the ostream class 
and it is used to output text. 
While cout is associated with the console 
(screen, cout is short for consoleout) 
file has been associated with the output stream 
directed towards the file you created. So in effect, 
file will work in the same way as cout, but instead 
of writing text to the screen, it will write it to biodata.txt. 
After all the data is written this program will close. 
You can now open biodata.txt manually and view it’s contents. 

Reading from a file [strings] 

Let us try and display the contents of biodata.txt 
on the screen using a C++ program. The code is as follows: 

</h5>
#include&lt;fstream.h&gt; 

#include&lt;conio.h&gt; 

void main() 

{ 

char ch; 

clrscr(); 

ifstream file; 

file.open("biodata.txt",ios::nocreate); 

if(!file) 

  { 

  cout&lt;&lt;"UNABLE TO OPEN FILE!!"; 

  goto end; 

  } 

while(file) 

     { 

     file.get(ch); 

     cout&lt;&lt;ch; 

     } 

getch(); 

end: 

file.close(); 

} 
<h5>
In this program we first open a file biodata.txt for reading, 
if the file doesn’t exist or the compiler cannot 
find it an error will be flagged. 
Then we enter a while loop whose duration 
is the point where the object file exists. 
The get() function extracts a single character 
from the file and stores it in a variable ch. 
The statement cout<<ch displays this 
character on the screen. In this way every character is extracted, 
one by one and displayed. After the last character is extracted, 
i.e. the email address is displayed, 
no more bytes of data are available to the compiler, 
hence file ceases to exist and we break out of the loop. 
After waiting for a key press the program terminates. 
There is no need for the file.close() function here, 
but I use it just to be clear and avoid ambiguity. 

Another point of note: If your file has moved to another 
folder the compiler might experience problems in trying to 
read it. A solution to it is that you enter the entire file 
path in the open function, such as: 

file.open(“c:\\mark\\biodata\\biodata.txt”,ios::nocreate); 

  \\ must be used instead of \ and if the folder name 
is more then 8 characters then MS-DOS names must 
be entered[i.e. c:\cool filez might 
be expressed as c:\\coolfi~1].
