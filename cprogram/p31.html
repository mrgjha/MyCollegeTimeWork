//If they contain just simple lines of code, use no for loops or the like, 
//C++ functions can be declared inline. This means their code will be inserted 
//right everywhere the function is used. That's somehow like a macro. 
//Main advantage is the program will be faster. A little drawback is it will be bigger,
// because the full code of the function was inserted everywhere it is used: 




using namespace std;
#include&lt;iostream&gt;
#include&lt;cmath&gt;



inline double hypothenuse (double a, double b)

{   

return sqrt (a * a + b * b);}
int main ()

{   

double k = 6, m = 9;   // Next two lines produce exactly the same code:  

cout << hypothenuse (k, m) << endl;   
cout << sqrt (k * k + m * m) << endl;   
return 0;

}

(The possibility to use inline functions has been added to C in C99 and ANSI C 2000.)
