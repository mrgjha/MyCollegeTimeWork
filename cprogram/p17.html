			<p>
				What is the meaning of term ‘Object Oriented’ and what is the need for it?
			</p>
			<p>
				Well…! To understand this first tell me what do you do when the battery (cell) 
				of your torch (or any other device) runs out? Probably, you simply replace the 
				battery with a new one. Is it? Now, what do you think, you know everything 
				about the battery and the torch. I mean their architecture, functionality, etc. 
				If, by any chance, you know also then does everybody who replaces the battery 
				know about the details of the battery and the device? Obviously not.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now think about other things that we come across in our daily lives like Cars, 
				Computers, Telephones or anything. Whenever something breaks down it is 
				probably repaired by the people who themselves do not know much about the 
				internal engineering of the object. For example, a car and a car mechanic; 
				torch and you, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				What we have noticed in above paragraphs is that many things in life are easy 
				to use and maintain because to use (or repair) them we do not need to know 
				about their internal details. I mean we don’t need to understand the 
				engineering of car to drive it…
			</p>
			<p>
				What we achieve by this phenomenon is revolutionary. Do you agree?
			</p>
			<p>
				Now what is this phenomenon basically? See, if we think for while, we’ll come 
				to know about two activities done by this phenomenon:
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Hiding the complexity of a system
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Providing a simple interface for the 
				functionality of the system
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, in a torch an interface is provided for putting the battery and 
				same is the case with battery which has interface which we can connect to the 
				torch. This way we easily link the two systems.
			</p>
			<p>
				This phenomenon is named <STRONG><FONT color="#3366ff">ABSTRACTION</FONT></STRONG>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Because of this abstraction the life becomes easy or rather possible. If 
				abstraction were not there, we would have to learn the chemistry of bread to 
				eat it. The equation of water to drink… At the root of all, we would have to 
				learn about atoms, electrons, etc. before using anything… Do you think we could 
				survive in such a condition?
			</p>
			<p>
				Because of this Abstraction we are where we are now… And because of this 
				abstraction only, we are able to make progress, grow…
			</p>
			<p>
				I hope you do agree with me? Is it? If not, please discuss… so that we can come 
				to a common conclusion…
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>... Abstraction and Programming&nbsp;... </b>
			</p>
			<p>
				The concept of Abstraction holds true for programming also. See, what does 
				Abstraction mean? It means <EM><FONT color="#3366ff">hiding the complexity of a system 
						and providing a simple interface</FONT></EM> for it. If can be able to 
				achieve Abstraction in programming, we can make the same progress as real life 
				in programming also. This can open a window to the infinite possibilities. We 
				will just make many systems and hide their complexities so that they can easily 
				be used anywhere by any one and this will give the scope of doing virtually 
				anything…
			</p>
			<p>
				The concept of abstraction is the basic idea behind the Object Oriented 
				Programming Paradigm. And because of this reason, this programming model is 
				most powerful and most used model in the world of programming. This makes 
				programming very powerful and yet very easy. And so makes our lives, as a 
				programmer, very easy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Basically, OOP suggests that a system must be made from simpler, independent 
				units which are capable of handling information and functionality related to 
				them independently. Such units are called Objects. The whole OOP revolves 
				around such objects, hence the name ‘Object Oriented’.
			</p>
			<p>
				In OOP model, we create and use ‘Objects’ to make our code much cleaner, 
				efficient, robust, easy to manage and maintain, and debug.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, I hope, you understand the meaning of OOP and the need for it?
			</p>
			<p><b> ... Classes and Objects ... </b>
			</p>
			<p>
				You are already familiar with the concept of an Object. An object, as we have 
				already seen, is a piece of code which is capable of handling information and 
				functionality related to it independently. We can visualize objects as small 
				components of a bigger system, which can be grouped together to develop the 
				system. For example, Computer is a system and the Hard Disk, RAM, Motherboard 
				are different objects used in a computer system. Often, the objects represent 
				some entity which is able to exist independently.
			</p>
			<p>
				If we want to use some object in our program, we only need to know what does 
				this object do and not how it does it….Abstraction again! To use it, we will 
				have to load the object in memory so that it can use the CPU and other 
				resources or simply run! Now, loading an object into memory is called <FONT color="#3366ff">
					<EM>Instantiation</EM></FONT>, in other words, whenever we load an object 
				we can say we have created an instance of it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Technically, an object is called an object when it is in an instantiated state 
				or loaded. This is so because then only we can actually use it… But there must 
				be some definition for this object, which describes the functionality of the 
				object. This definition is called the <FONT color="#3366ff">Class</FONT>. 
				Please note that a <FONT color="#3366ff">class is not an object</FONT>. It is 
				just a set of instructions telling how an object should work.
			</p>
			<p>
				To understand this let us take an example. All of you must be familiar with the 
				house map. It contains the details of a how to make a house, where to put 
				windows, where to keep the doors, and how many rooms should be there, of what 
				sizes, etc. Is that ‘map’ the house itself? No. A map is just the instruction 
				set and what we create from it is a house, which is a physical/actual thing 
				made up of cement and concrete which can be used to live in. The same relation 
				exists between a class and an object.
			</p>
			<p><FONT color="#ff3366"> Map&nbsp;\-----\&nbsp;House<br>
					Class \-----\ Object</FONT>
			</p>
			<UL>
				<LI>
				A map is instruction set for the house and similarly class is an instruction 
				set for the object.
				<LI>
				House is the actual thing we are bothered about and so is the object.
				<LI>
				Many houses can be created from a map and similarly many objects can be created 
				or instantiated from a class.
				<LI>
					House occupies some space actually and not the map. Similarly, an Object gets 
					loaded and uses the memory not the class.&nbsp;<FONT color="#3366ff">A class is 
						just a set of instructions which specify how an object should look like and 
						what should it do.</FONT>
				</LI>
			</UL>
			<P>I hope now you have a clear about the class and the objects. <FONT color="#3366ff">An 
					object is a programming unit and class is definition of the </FONT><FONT color="#3366ff">
					object.</FONT> If still not clear, please discuss.
			</P>
			<P>Now, let’s see some of the terms associated with the Object Oriented Programming 
				Paradigm.
			</P>
			<P><STRONG>... Encapsulation ...</STRONG></P>
			<P>This is nothing but what we have already seen. This concept simply suggests that 
				the code, that is, the data and the functionality must be <EM><FONT color="#3366ff">encapsulated</FONT></EM>
				in a ‘black box’. Or simply we can say that the actual code must be hidden from 
				the users of the code. Practically this is what happens when we use Objects. We 
				don’t actually see the code behind an object, we can just use it. This concept 
				is also called <FONT color="#3366ff">‘Data hiding’</FONT>.
			</P>
			<P><STRONG>... Inheritance ...</STRONG></P>
			<P>To understand the meaning of <FONT color="#3366ff">Inheritance</FONT> in 
				programming context, let’s see an example. Let us consider that there is an 
				Animal class. It has all the features of a general animal. When I say <FONT color="#3366ff">
					general</FONT> animal, I mean not any particular animal. The class defines 
				4 legs, 2 eyes, 1 tail, etc. and also the functionality like Sleeping, Running, 
				etc. Now, if I need to get a lion, I don’t need to write the whole class all 
				over again. I can just <FONT color="#3366ff">inherit</FONT> my lion class from 
				the animal class. When I do this I will only have to write code for the 
				additional features of Lion like Roaring, etc.
			</P>
			<P>This facility is available in the Object Oriented Programming Paradigm and it 
				greatly supports code reuse. We can inherit from a <FONT color="#3366ff">Superclass</FONT>
				and the class which inherits a superclass is called a <FONT color="#3366ff">Subclass</FONT>
				in OOP.
			</P>
			<P><STRONG>... Polymorphism ...</STRONG></P>
			<P>Polymorphism in OOP means <FONT color="#3366ff"><EM>‘same name different functionality’</EM></FONT>. 
				What this means in action is that we have a same name for different 
				functionalities. For example, we have the same name – ‘Sleep’ which we can use 
				for making each animal sleep, be it tiger or lion or cat or anything. What I 
				mean is that the method for sleeping is different in each of these 
				cases/animals… Cat sleeps differently than a tiger and so on, but we still use 
				‘Sleep’ to make all animals sleep. This means that we have different 
				functionalities but having the same name that is <FONT color="#3366ff">Sleep</FONT>. 
				This is <FONT color="#3366ff">Polymorphism</FONT> <FONT color="#3366ff">(many + 
					forms)</FONT>.
			</P>
			<P>There are two terms generally used in this context:
			</P>
			<UL>
				<LI>
					Overloading
				</LI>
				<LI>
					Overriding
				</LI>
			</UL>
			<P><EM><STRONG>Overloading </STRONG></EM>
			</P>
			<P>Whenever we introduce/write a new functionality with the same name as an 
				existing functionality but changing the signature, we are implementing 
				Overloading. In overloading we can differentiate between the two 
				functionalities by their signatures. And the call made to that functionality 
				depends on the context. This way both the functionalities can co-exist.
			</P>
			<P><STRONG><EM>Overriding </EM></STRONG>
			</P>
			<P>Whenever we write a new functionality with the name and signature both same, the 
				existing functionality gets <EM>overridden</EM> by the new functionality and 
				hence can’t be use. When a call to the functionality is made, only the new 
				functionality is called. This is called <EM>Overriding</EM>.
			</P>
			<P>This was just an introduction to the concept of OOP and the various terms used 
				in it. But the real fun is in using these concepts…
