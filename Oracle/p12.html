Prime attribute - attribute that is member of the primary key K<br><br>

{SSN, PNUMBER}->HOURS is a full FD<br>since neither SSN->HOURS nor PNUMBER->HOURS hold 
<br><br>{SSN, PNUMBER}->ENAME is not  a full FD (it is called a partial dependency )
since SSN->ENAME also holds

<p>
<h3>Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)</h3>
<ul><li>Every determinant in the table is a candidate key
<ul>
<li>Determinant is attribute whose value determines other values in row
</ul>
<li>This is equivalent to 3rd normal form plus it prohibits prime attributes depending on non-prime attributes. 
<li>3NF table with one candidate key is already in BCNF
</ul>
