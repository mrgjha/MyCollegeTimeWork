CREATE TABLE tab1 (col1 VARCHAR2(6), col2 CHAR(6),
        col3 VARCHAR2(6), col4 CHAR(6) );

Table created.

INSERT INTO tab1 (col1,  col2,     col3,     col4)
        VALUES   ('abc', 'def   ', 'ghi   ', 'jkl');

1 row created.

SELECT col1||col2||col3||col4 "Concatenation"
        FROM tab1;

SELECT * FROM emp  WHERE sal = 1500;
SELECT * FROM emp  WHERE sal != 1500;
SELECT * FROM emp  WHERE sal > 1500;
SELECT * FROM emp  WHERE sal < 1500;
SELECT * FROM emp  WHERE sal >= 1500;
SELECT * FROM emp  WHERE sal <= 1500;

  

SELECT * FROM emp  WHERE job IN ('CLERK','ANALYST');
SELECT * FROM emp  WHERE sal IN  (SELECT sal FROM emp WHERE deptno = 30);
SELECT * FROM emp  WHERE sal NOT IN  (SELECT sal FROM emp  WHERE deptno = 30);
SELECT * FROM emp  WHERE job NOT IN  ('CLERK', ANALYST');

  

SELECT * FROM emp  WHERE sal = ANY (SELECT sal FROM emp  WHERE deptno = 30);

SELECT * FROM emp  WHERE sal >=  ALL ( 1400, 3000);


SELECT * FROM emp  WHERE sal  BETWEEN 2000 AND 3000;


SELECT ename deptno FROM dept WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM emp WHERE dept.deptno = emp.deptno);
SELECT * FROM tab1  WHERE col1 LIKE  'A_C/%E%' ESCAPE '/';
SELECT ename, deptno  FROM emp  WHERE comm IS NULL;


SELECT 'TRUE' 
    FROM emp 
    WHERE deptno NOT IN (5,15); 


However, the following statement returns no rows: 

SELECT 'TRUE' 
    FROM emp 
    WHERE deptno NOT IN (5,15,null);
