<H2>What is a database?</H2>
<P>This may seem a pretty fundamental question, but unless you know what a 
database consists of you may find it difficult to build one that can be used 
effectively. Here is a simple definition of a database:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A database is a collection of information that is organised so 
  that it can easily be accessed, managed, and updated.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A database engine may comply with a combination of any of the following:</P>
<UL class=compress>
  <LI>The database is a collection of table, files or datasets. 
  <LI>Each table is a collection of fields, columns or data items. 
  <LI>One or more columns in each table may be selected as the primary key. 
  <LI>There may be additional unique keys or non-unique indexes to assist in 
  data retrieval. 
  <LI>Columns may be fixed length or variable length. 
  <LI>Records amy be fixed length or variable length. 
  <LI>Table and column names may be restricted in length (8, 16 or 32 
  characters). 
  <LI>Table and column names may be case-sensitive. </LI></UL>
