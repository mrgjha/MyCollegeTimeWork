<H2>How to use PL/SQL?</H2>
<p>Without PL/SQL,the oracle server must process each SQL statement individually.
<br>Each statement results in high performance overhead due to the additional call for each statement.<br>
With PL/SQL,an entire block of statements can be sent to Oracle at one time.
<br>This reduces the network traffic between your application and the oracle server.</p>
